This game started as a schoolproject a couple of years ago. After some very elaborate space/planet exploration game we decided to strip all things en just keep the core mechanic that consisted of the planet hopping.

Back then the game was received pretty well, our classmates loved it and we even ended up in trending in the PlayStore. After half a year the game got deleted by Google due to a lack of updates.

Now I’ve decided to revamp the mobile game and release it again for Android and also iOS this time. I’ll update this page with the download links as soon as the game is available on both platforms.

Also for support just leave a comment here or on the App/PlayStore.
