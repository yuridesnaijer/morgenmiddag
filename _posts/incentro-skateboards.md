Incentro, as the sponsor of the dutch skateboard federation, asked me to design a pair of decorative skateboards. The world of Incentro revolves around Incentronauts and having offices around 5 continents by 2022. I took this ambition as a guideline and made a storytelling quadtriptych that takes them to another planet.

Acrylics and markers on skateboards.
